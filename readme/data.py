Lennart ist VFX Artist und Tausendsassa, lebt aktuell in Vancouver und arbeitet als Effects Pipeline TD bei Animal Logic. Wir sprechen mit ihm über seine Karriere, welche von einen Job beim Spiegel über die Arbeit bei Pixmondo bis zu seiner jetzigen Position bei Animal Logic geführt hat. Es geht um Jobwechsel, Native People und den VFX Standort Vancouver. Wir lernen viel über die Branche, wie lang man für einen animierten Film brauchen kann und wie aufwändig einzelne Shots sein können. Zu Lennart's Portfolio gehören Filme oder Serien wir „Man In Black“, „International“, „Midway“ oder „Ms. Marvel“ - hört also rein, es wird spannend!",
